## Getting Started

Clone this repository in your computer:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/calaca/reactnd-mobile-flashcards.git
```

Or [download](https://github.com/calaca/reactnd-mobile-flashcards/archive/master.zip) it as a ZIP file.

### Prerequisites

- A smartphone or a mobile emulator
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started)

### Installing

Open a terminal at the project root:
1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`
3. Follow the expo instructions to open the app

To open the app make sure you have a working emulator on your PC or an Android/iOS at hand.

### Scripts

- `yarn start`: runs the app in development mode
- `yarn run ios`: builds the app for iOS
- `yarn run test`: runs the test watcher in an interactive mode
- `yarn run eject`: ejects the app so you have full control over configuration files and transitive dependencies

## Running the project

### Development

1. Open a terminal at project root
4. Run the React Native app with `yarn start`
5. Start coding!

### Production

Run a build with `yarn run android` or `yarn run ios`.

## Tests

This app has been tested on an Android device v7.1.1.

### Running the tests

Tests will be coming soon.

## Known issues

- This app has Promises in it and it's known that expo can ignore some of them and never resolve them. To fix this, please close expo and open it again along with the app. If the issue persists clear expo data and cache on your phone. You can see an issue about this [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6679).
- You may need to make sure your phone and PC have the same time, otherwise [an error](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/5823) will show up.
